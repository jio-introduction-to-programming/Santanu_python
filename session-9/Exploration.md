Purpose and Functionality:
Pillow is a popular and user-friendly Python Imaging Library (PIL) fork. It provides functionalities to open, manipulate, and save various image file formats. With Pillow, you can perform tasks like resizing images, applying filters, converting image formats, and more.

Installation:
You can install Pillow using pip:

Copy code
pip install pillow
Usage:

python
Copy code
from PIL import Image

# Open an image
image = Image.open("example.jpg")

# Resize the image
resized_image = image.resize((300, 200))

# Save the resized image
resized_image.save("resized_example.jpg")
In this example, we open an image, resize it to 300x200 pixels, and save the resized image as "resized_example.jpg". Pillow provides a straightforward API for image manipulation tasks, making it a valuable package for handling images in Python projects.
